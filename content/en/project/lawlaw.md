## Project Overview
The Law Law project aimed at developing an intelligent question and answer bot capable of handling legal-like queries. The project utilized a Seq2Seq model in PyTorch, where the encoder was constructed with a two-layer bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the decoder with a two-layer unidirectional GRU.
## Key Features
- **Seq2Seq Model**: Adopted a Sequence to Sequence model architecture to generate accurate and contextually relevant answers to legal-like questions.
- **Advanced RNN Architecture**: Employed GRUs in both the encoder and decoder to efficiently capture the temporal dependencies in the question-answer pairs.
