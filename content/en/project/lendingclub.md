The project is an independently completed personal open source project.

- Project Description: Based on the lending club dataset, this project explores how to improve the accuracy of predicting whether to grant a loan or not by using machine learning and deep learning methods.

- Responsible part: done independently. The project is based on the lending club dataset and uses lightgbm as the baseline to predict whether to give a loan or not. Based on CatBoostEncoder, clustering, exponential zone division and business logic analysis, four groups of derivative variables were analyzed for improving the effect, then multiple machine learning methods were used for prediction, and the accuracy was improved by 0.2% by integration through voting fusion and Stacking's stacking and blending, then DNN method was used, and SGD and Adam were tried. Optimizer for model training to optimize the accuracy, but the effect is still poor, using Tabnet to try, the effect is poor, using Stacking stacking integration of machine learning methods and DNN methods to increase the accuracy by 0.3%
