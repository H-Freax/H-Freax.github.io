Act as project leader

- Project Description: Due to the inability to network in the hospital internal deployment environment, the DBI  used VC++ to write the database data and the corresponding structure of the Oracle side in the enterprise side, exported to the Access side and saved as .mdb format, and imported the .mdb file into the Oracle side in the client-side.

- Responsible for the part: based on the original tool to additionally enter the notes and default values characteristic of the table structure while entering the information related to the temporary table

- Completion: Based on no contact with VC++, through two weeks of study and reading of source code, I completed the development task independently in advance, solved the part of the original business that needed to be transferred manually, and improved the efficiency by 30% of the company's on-site database deployment.
