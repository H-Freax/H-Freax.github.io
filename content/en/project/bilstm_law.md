## Project Overview

This independent project was dedicated to the development of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system tailored for legal texts. Utilizing the PyTorch framework, the project implemented a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network combined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer to effectively identify and classify named entities within legal documents.

## Achievements

- **High Accuracy**: Successfully achieved 88% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BiLSTM + CRF architecture in the context of legal text NER.
- **Advanced Model Architecture**: The use of BiLSTM allowed for capturing contextual information from both past and future tokens, while the CRF layer modeled the dependencies between labels for accurate entity classification.
