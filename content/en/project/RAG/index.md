## Project Description:
Athena's Oracle is an innovative document analysis platform designed to enhance the efficiency of academic and professional research. Inspired by the wisdom of the ancient goddess Athena, this tool employs advanced AI and natural language processing techniques to parse and understand vast volumes of textual content, providing insights and answers with unprecedented depth and accuracy.

## Responsibilities:

- Developed the core algorithm using Python, integrating technologies such as FAISS for efficient vector search and LangChain for incorporating language models.
- Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling users to interact seamlessly with the application.
- Managed the integration of the OpenAI API to utilize cutting-edge AI models for question answering and document retrieval.
- Conducted comprehensive testing and optimization to ensure robustness and reliability of the platform.

## Key Achievements:

- Successfully enabled batch downloading of academic papers and automated knowledge base construction using arXiv-downloader.
- Implemented Reciprocal Rank Fusion to aggregate results from multiple sources, enhancing the relevancy and quality of information retrieval.
- Contributed to open source by sharing the development journey and tutorials through Medium and Zhihu, aiding others in learning and applying similar technologies.
