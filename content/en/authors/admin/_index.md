I am a graduate of Wenzhou Institute of Technology, currently working as a technical manager in Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co. In the first semester of senior year, based on the mastered text processing technology, he was in charge of guiding students' data mining based on text processing in the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining of Wenzhou University under the responsibility of Mr. Xu Xu. After graduation, I focused on complete development of key node projects in enterprises to facilitate enterprise business in my working time, and continued to learn and explore deep learning direction in my spare time to optimize the algorithm parts involved in the projects I completed in the past. Earlier in my research career, I was more inclined to use machine learning algorithms for text processing, and now I have broadened my horizon on methods for processing data by learning deep learning algorithms and new models that have emerged in recent years. During this learning process, I have been very interested in the directions listed in my hobbies.

If you have any ideas, please [contact me](#contact).
