## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨

Welcome to my personal space on the internet! I'm a graduate student in the Information System program at Northeastern University, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of robotics and artificial intelligence as a Research Intern at The Helping Hands Lab under the guidance of Dr. Robert Platt. [Check out my profile on the Helping Hands Lab website!](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/)

Additionally, I'm also a Research Assistant at the Information Experience and Accessibility Lab in the iSchool at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, led by [Dr. Rachel F. Adler](http://rachelfadler.com), where I'm actively involved in research related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

## About Me

I worked as a Technical Manager at Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co., improving system efficiencies. After earning my degree from Wenzhou University of Technology, where I worked on news sentiment analysis with Professor Xianming Wang, my interest in text-based data mining grew while assisting Associate Professor Xu Xu.

## Meet My Pets

### Lucas
<img alt="Lucas" height="100px" src="img/lucas.png" width="100px"/>
Lucas is a very self-important cat. Although he looks unhappy most days, he actually loves to be pampered. Every day, he makes sure to find time to come to me for cuddles and pets.

### Cookie
<img alt="Cookie" height="100px" src="img/cookie.png" width="100px"/>
Cookie is a dog that's extremely attached to her owner. She loves following me around and seems like she can't be apart from me at all. Cookie has a cheerful personality and is always smiling, giving off a happy vibe. She seems like she's happy 25 hours a day!

Thank you for visiting my page. Let's make something great together!
