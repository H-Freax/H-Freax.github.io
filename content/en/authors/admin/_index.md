I am currently a graduate student in the Information System program at Northeastern University, serving as a Research Intern in The Helping Hands Lab led by Dr. Robert Platt. I graduated from Wenzhou University of Technology, where I actively engaged in news sentiment analysis based on Wenzhou News under the guidance of Professor Xianming Wang at Wenzhou Bopu Big Data Research Institute. Additionally, I had the opportunity to assist in guiding students in text-based data mining at the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining at Wenzhou University, under the leadership of Associate Professor Xu Xu. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a profound interest in the research areas outlined in my interests.
