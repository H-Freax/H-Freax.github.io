## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨

Welcome to my personal space on the internet! I'm a graduate student in the Information System program at Northeastern University, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of robotics and artificial intelligence as a Research Intern at The Helping Hands Lab under the guidance of Dr. Robert Platt. [Check out my profile on the Helping Hands Lab website!](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/)

Additionally, I'm also a Research Assistant at the Information Experience and Accessibility Lab in the iSchool at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, led by [Dr. Rachel F. Adler](http://rachelfadler.com), where I'm actively involved in research related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

## About Me

I worked as a Technical Manager at Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co., improving system efficiencies. After earning my degree from Wenzhou University of Technology, where I worked on news sentiment analysis with Professor Xianming Wang, my interest in text-based data mining grew while assisting Associate Professor Xu Xu. 

## What I'm Up To

- 🌱 Exploring robotics and AI to develop innovative solutions.
- 📝 Writing articles on platforms like [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38155541), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/freax-23/posts), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@limyoonaxi).
- 🚀 Engaging with the open-source community on [GitHub](https://github.com/H-Freax), including my latest project, [GraspNet and Pointnet2 PyTorch Upgrade (v1.13.1)](https://github.com/H-Freax/GraspNet_Pointnet2_PyTorch1.13.1), which provides a stable and reliable implementation of these tools.
