I'm a graduate student in the program of Information System at Northeastern University.  Graduated from the Wenzhou University of Technology, I have practiced Wenzhou News-based news opinion analysis under the guidance of Prof. Xianming Wang from Wenzhou Bopu Big Data Research Institute and was responsible for helping to guide students in text-based data mining at the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining at Wenzhou University under the responsibility of Associate Prof. Xu Xu.    During this study process, I was very interested in the directions listed in the research interests.
