Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm a fourth-year undergraduate (looking for a Systems Ph.D. position) of computer science at [WHU](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in the group of [Prof. Yanjiao Chen](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/ychen/). Currently, I serve as a research intern at [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) working with [Prof. Ben Leong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~bleong/). In the early career stage, I'm interested in exploring *solid and widely beneficial things related to Systems research* like database, networking, PL/SE, and security. Some strategic locations on the ðŸ“¡ map of the currently discovered battlefield: Congestion Control, Dietary Detection, and Software Configuration Analysis.

*None of us is as smart as all of us.* If you have any ideas, please [contact me](#contact).
