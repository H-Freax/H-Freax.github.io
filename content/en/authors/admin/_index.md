## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨

Welcome to my personal space on the internet! I'm a graduate student in the Information System program at Northeastern University, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of robotics and artificial intelligence as a Research Intern at The Helping Hands Lab under the guidance of Dr. Robert Platt. [Check out my profile on the Helping Hands Lab website!](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/)

## About Me

After earning my degree from Wenzhou University of Technology, where I dived deep into news sentiment analysis with Professor Xianming Wang at Wenzhou Bopu Big Data Research Institute, my passion for data-driven insights and technology only grew stronger. My time assisting Associate Professor Xu Xu at the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining further solidified my interest in text-based data mining, laying a solid foundation for my current research endeavors.

## What I'm Up To

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the vast and exciting field of robotics, aiming to leverage my skills in information systems and data analysis to contribute to innovative solutions.
- 📝 Sharing my journey and insights through articles on platforms like [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38155541), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/freax-23/posts), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@limyoonaxi), including my latest article on RAG technology in "Athena's Oracle."
- 🚀 Engaging with the open-source community through projects and collaborations on [GitHub](https://github.com/H-Freax), featuring my latest work on the PATPAT project. Check out the product introduction on [YouTube](https://studio.youtube.com/video/mtMAw2oCKwg/edit). I'm delighted to announce that we secured the 3rd Place in the Inter-Disciplinary Category at the paper2product hackathon, showcasing the innovative potential of our work.
