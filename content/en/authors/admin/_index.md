## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨


Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’ve just wrapped up my first year of graduate school at Northeastern University. Alongside this, I’m currently a **Machine Learning Engineer Co-op** at **Lendbuzz**, where I’m applying my skills in AI to solve real-world problems in the fintech space.

In addition, I’m involved in **robotics and artificial intelligence** research as a Research Intern at **The Helping Hands Lab**, working under the guidance of [Dr. Robert Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/) on **robotic grasping and manipulation systems**. I also contribute as a Research Assistant at the **CHATS Lab** (Conversation, Human-AI Technology, Security) under [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/), where we focus on **interactive AI systems**, **privacy-preserving AI**, and **multi-modal conversational agents**.

On the accessibility front, I collaborate with [Dr. Rachel F. Adler](http://rachelfadler.com) at the **Information Experience and Accessibility Lab** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign** on projects that aim to improve accessibility in **fintech** and **mHealth** for older adults.

## About Me

Before stepping into graduate school, I served as a **Technical Manager** at Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co., where I developed tools and systems that improved operational efficiencies by up to 80%. At **Wenzhou University of Technology**, under the guidance of **Professors Xianming Wang** and **Xu Xu**, I focused on strategic insights for soccer teams and performed sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews. At **Wenzhou Bopu Institute of Big Data**, mentored by **Professor Xianming Wang**, I led public opinion analysis projects. I also worked with **Professor Huaqing Mao** at **MIE DEMO Studio**, where I launched an innovative volunteer management platform.

🌟🌟Feel free to reach out! Whether it’s for research, collaboration, or just to exchange ideas over a casual chat, I’m always open to connecting and exploring new possibilities!🌟🌟

## Meet My Pets

### Lucas

Lucas may seem a little serious, but don’t be fooled! He’s actually quite the pampered cat and loves attention. Even with his perpetually unimpressed look, he always makes time for cuddles and affection every day.

### Cookie

Cookie is my constant companion—she can’t stand being apart from me! With her cheerful personality and always-smiling face, she radiates happiness. It feels like Cookie is joyful every single moment, like she’s living in a world with 25 hours of happiness each day!

**Thank you for visiting my page. Let's make something great together!**
