## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨

Welcome to my personal space on the internet! I'm a graduate student in the Information System program at Northeastern University, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of robotics and artificial intelligence as a Research Intern at The Helping Hands Lab under the guidance of Dr. Robert Platt.

## About Me

After earning my degree from Wenzhou University of Technology, where I dived deep into news sentiment analysis with Professor Xianming Wang at Wenzhou Bopu Big Data Research Institute, my passion for data-driven insights and technology only grew stronger. My time assisting Associate Professor Xu Xu at the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining further solidified my interest in text-based data mining, laying a solid foundation for my current research endeavors.

## What I'm Up To

- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the vast and exciting field of robotics, aiming to leverage my skills in information systems and data analysis to contribute to innovative solutions.
- 📝 Sharing my journey and insights through articles on platforms like [CSDN](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_38155541), [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/freax-23/posts), and [Medium](https://medium.com/@limyoonaxi).
