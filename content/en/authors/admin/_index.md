## Hi there 👋, I'm Yaoyao Qian (Freax Ruby) ✨


Hi there! 🌟 As I gear up for my second year at Northeastern University, I reflect on my journey so far. My time as a **Machine Learning Engineer Co-op** at **Lendbuzz** was a standout experience. Integrating vLLM into systems and achieving a 175% inference speedup was a highlight, combining technical challenges with real-world impact. 

I’m also immersed in exciting research at **The Helping Hands Lab**, guided by [Dr. Robert Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/), where I work on advancing **robotic grasping and manipulation systems**. 🤖 At the **CHATS Lab** under [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/), my focus lies on building **interactive AI systems**, **privacy-preserving AI**, and **multi-modal conversational agents**. 💬

On a different front, I collaborate with [Dr. Rachel F. Adler](http://rachelfadler.com) at the **Information Experience and Accessibility Lab** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**. Here, I contribute to projects enhancing accessibility in **fintech** and **mHealth** for older adults. 🏦

## About Me

Before grad school, I honed my skills as a **Technical Manager** at Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co., driving operational improvements of up to 80%. My academic path included impactful research at **Wenzhou University of Technology**, **Wenzhou Bopu Institute of Big Data**, and **MIE DEMO Studio**, where I tackled diverse projects from public opinion analysis to launching a volunteer management platform. 

_**Feel free to reach out! ✨ Whether for collaboration, brainstorming, or just exchanging ideas, I’d love to connect and explore new possibilities together. 💡**_

## Meet My Pets

### Lucas

Lucas may seem a little serious, but don’t be fooled! He’s actually quite the pampered cat and loves attention. Even with his perpetually unimpressed look, he always makes time for cuddles and affection every day.

### Cookie

Cookie is my constant companion—she can’t stand being apart from me! With her cheerful personality and always-smiling face, she radiates happiness. It feels like Cookie is joyful every single moment, like she’s living in a world with 25 hours of happiness each day!

**Thank you for visiting my page. Let's make something great together!**
