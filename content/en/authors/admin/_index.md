I am a graduate of the Wenzhou Institute of Technology, currently working as a technical manager in Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhonghan Medical Technology Co. Since my sophomore year in college, I have been working in Wenzhou Bopu Big Data Research Institute as the technical leader of the student department. Under the guidance of professor Xianming Wang, I started to explore the content related to natural language processing and the learning of recommendation systems. I practiced the news opinion analysis based on Wenzhou News Network. In the first semester of my fourth year in college, I was responsible for helping to guide students in data mining based on text processing in the Institute of Modeling and Data Mining at Wenzhou University, which is under the responsibility of Associate Professor Xu Xu.  After graduation, I focused on developing key node projects in enterprises to facilitate enterprise business. In my spare time, I focused on learning and exploring deep understanding, and optimizing the algorithm parts involved in the projects I completed in the past. Earlier in my research career, I was more inclined to use machine learning algorithms for text processing. Now I have broadened my horizon on methods for processing data by learning deep learning algorithms and new models that have emerged in recent years. During this learning process, I have been very interested in the directions listed in my hobbies.

If you have any ideas, please [contact me](#contact).
