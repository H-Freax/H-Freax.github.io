Co-advised by [Prof. Yanjiao Chen](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/ychen/) and [Prof. Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/)

- Employed deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as DQN to generate congestion control policy
- Widely evaluated the designed scheme and state-of-the-art TCP variants on emulated and real networks via Mahimahi and Pantheon platform
